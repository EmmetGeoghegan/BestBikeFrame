# Python-TheBestShape
Code to find the best shape for a bikeframe using given materials <br>
Created as part of the stokes modelling workshop in NUIG <br>
Awarded 1st place <br>
<br>


## Objectives
Your task with the bike frame is to maximize stiffness for a given total stress-free length of the rods. </br>
This requires some intermediate passages: </br>
I) leave the coordinates of one hinge free; </br>
II) express the frame stiffness in terms of (x,y); </br>
III) impose the constraint on the total mass; </br>
IV) maximize the stiffness by playing on (x,y). </br>

# Instructions:
* Solution for original posed problem can be found in main.py
* Solution for a chosen length can be generated using givenlength.py
* foreverylength.py was used as a test environment
