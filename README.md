# Python-TheBestShape

## To-do List
* Finish Node Class
* Finish Truss Class
* Add truss properties
* Make truss generator
* Make Node generator
* Apply a force
* Calculate movements
* Least movement is our fitness function
* Use pymunk to simulate

## Bike Stuff Objectives
Your task with the bike frame is to maximize stiffness for a given total stress-free length of the rods. </br>
This requires some intermediate passages: </br>
I) leave the coordinates of one hinge free; </br>
II) express the frame stiffness in terms of (x,y); </br>
III) impose the constraint on the total mass; </br>
IV) maximize the stiffness by playing on (x,y). </br>

### To-do List
* Make generator that takes available truss length as constructor
