# Python-TheBestShape
Code to find the best shape for a bikeframe using given materials <br>
Created as part of the stokes modelling workshop in NUIG <br>
Awarded first place <br>
<br>
## To-do List
<s> Finish Node Class </s></br>
<s> Finish Truss Class </s></br>
<s> Add truss properties </s></br>
<s> Make truss generator </s></br>
<s> Make Node generator </s></br>
* Apply a force
* Calculate movements
* Least movement is our fitness function
* Use pymunk to simulate
* Make generator that takes available truss length as constructor


## Bike Stuff Objectives
Your task with the bike frame is to maximize stiffness for a given total stress-free length of the rods. </br>
This requires some intermediate passages: </br>
I) leave the coordinates of one hinge free; </br>
II) express the frame stiffness in terms of (x,y); </br>
III) impose the constraint on the total mass; </br>
IV) maximize the stiffness by playing on (x,y). </br>
